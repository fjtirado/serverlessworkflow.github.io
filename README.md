# Serverless Workflow Website Repository

This repository hosts the website for the [Serveless Workflow Specification](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification) project at [https://serverlessworkflow.io](https://serverlessworkflow.io).

## Contributing to the website

The website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/). You can find more information about how to get started with this stack [here](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/).

To contribute to the website you don't need to have in-deth web design knowledge:

- To add a new content [follow this guide](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/content/)
- To publish a blog post just add a new Markdown page to the [`blog`](blog) directory. You can always use the blog posts in this repository as a reference. [Here's a good example](https://github.com/google/docsy-example/blob/main/content/en/blog/releases/in-depth-monoliths-detailed-spec.md).
- For more complex changes to the website, look at the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) repository as a reference. Sometimes you might need to change the [default templates](https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/main/layouts) to accomodate custom changes.
